# A Comparison of Network Architectures

This is a comparison of Network Architectures in the accuracy - operations - model_size space.  
The repo will be regularly updated if new network architectures come out. Let me know
if you have any suggestions for architectures to add, or if any relevant data is missing.

All these images are based on the work done by [Canziani et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07678).
